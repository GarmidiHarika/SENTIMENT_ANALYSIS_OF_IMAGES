# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF IMAGES
This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment conveyed by images using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques. By leveraging pre-trained models and custom algorithms, the system can classify images into various sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. 

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Efficient handling of image data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Accurate categorization of image sentiment.
- **Model Integration**: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy / Pandas

## Use Cases
